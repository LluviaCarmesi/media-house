# What is it?
This is a project that serves videos on a website
#### Back End
It uses Golang (used to be dotnet, but I wanted to learn how to use Golang) as the back-end to save, get, and update videos.
#### Front End
Svelte.js is used as the front-end
#### Database
MySQL is used as the database

# TODO
1. Get Shows to show up on shows page. When clicking on a show, it should show the collection of videos for it.
2. Allow editing of a video
3. When playing a video, have an edit button underneath that navigates to the edit video page for that video
4. Show dropdown showing how they want to order the videos (alphabetically, created date, modified date)
